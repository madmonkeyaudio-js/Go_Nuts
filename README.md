              If the scores are tied, there is a final battle round. Beware of
              the player with the most health!

        Controls: 

        Player 1: Up, Down, Left, Right Arrows. 

        Player 2: W, S, A, D. 

        Known bugs: 
        
        1. At the end of each round/reset, for each item type 
        remaining on the map, only the one that appeared last 
        will disappear. The others become inaccessible. 

        2. The reset button works as long as there hasn't already 
        been a win condition. Otherwise the game runs through round 1 
        and then quits.
